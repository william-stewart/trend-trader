This application is meant to create an platform for configuring automated stock trading bots (ex: correlates trending businesses on twitter to swings in stock market prices) and makes buy/sell decisions on those correlations. The engine is being designed to be fully self sufficient during trading periods.

Application goals:
1)create a self sustaining system that feeds on twitter trends to drive stock buy/sell decisions
2)create database of custom statistics
3)be able to access these statistics remotely in real time through mobile and desktop views
4)be able to make decisions when to buy/sell stocks based on statistic factors and confidence levels
5)make application scalable and deployable instantly
6)use language learning to associate particular words to particular businesses

Educational goals:
1)learn and adhere to golang standards
2)make security driven design decisions
3)stand up an infrastructure to support 24 hour autonomous statistics processing and decision making
4)integrate an ai learning algorithm
5)have a lot of fun with it(this is a late nights after a days work kind of project)
6)volatility in the stock market is driven by "understandings" and "theories" of how it works,
so why don't I create a sandbox to test theories and understandings in realtime at no cost
